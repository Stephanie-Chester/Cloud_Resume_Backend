## AWS Cloud Resume Project
 
This repo is my attempt at the Cloud Resume Challenge created by Forrest Brazeal. I have done this challenge in AWS cloud. The steps to the challenge are listed in the link below on Forrest's website. After I am done with the challenge I will also link my blog here in this space.
